## 🚀 Project participating in the [Solana Mobile Hackathon](https://solanamobile.radiant.nexus/)

DegenLadder is a Solana Mobile app that ranks Solana traders based on their performance across different platforms (pump.fun, letsbonk.fun, more coming soon).

On-chain trading is a real PVP (Player vs Player) game, but how do you know who's winning and who's losing in the trenches ? DegenLadder finally provides the answer !

- Real-time leaderboard
- Detailed statistics per user and platform

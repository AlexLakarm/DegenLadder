  <strong>The Ultimate Solana Trading Leaderboard</strong><br/>
  <em>Track, rank, and compete with the best Solana traders across multiple platforms</em>
</p>

## 🚀 Solana Mobile Hackathon Project

**DegenLadder** is a revolutionary mobile app that transforms how we track and rank Solana traders. Built specifically for the Solana Mobile ecosystem, it provides real-time insights into trading performance across the most popular Solana trading platforms.

### 🎯 The Problem We Solve

In the fast-paced world of Solana trading, success is measured by performance, but there's no unified way to track who's truly winning across different platforms. Traders are scattered across pump.fun, letsbonk.fun, and other emerging platforms with no way to compare their performance or establish a true leaderboard.

**DegenLadder solves this by creating the first comprehensive, cross-platform trading leaderboard for Solana.**

### ✨ Key Features

- 🏆 **Real-time Global Leaderboard** - See where you rank among all Solana traders
- 📊 **Cross-Platform Analytics** - Track performance across pump.fun, letsbonk.fun, and more
- 🔄 **Live Data Updates** - Automatic refresh of trading data and rankings
- 📱 **Mobile-First Design** - Optimized for Solana Mobile with smooth UX
- 🔍 **Detailed User Profiles** - Deep dive into individual trader statistics
- 🎮 **Competitive Rankings** - Win rate, PNL, and degen score tracking
- 🔒 **Privacy-First** - GDPR compliant with public blockchain data only
- 🌐 **100% Open Source** - Transparent and community-driven

### Platforms (07/20/2025)

### 🎮 How It Works

1. **Connect Your Wallet** - Seamless integration with Solana Mobile wallets

3. **Track Performance** - Monitor your wins, losses, and overall score
4. **Compete & Improve** - Challenge yourself to climb the ranks
